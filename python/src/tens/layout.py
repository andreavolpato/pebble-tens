"""Exact geometry on the 200×228 Pebble Time 2 canvas.

All layout decisions are resolved here, before the scene is built. Everything
is integer pixels so geometry is deterministic and the resulting scene
contains no hidden auto-layout.

Mental model — a grid of grids:

    day   = grid of 24 hour-blocks      (e.g. 6 wide x 4 tall)
    hour  = grid of 6 ten-minute boxes  (e.g. 2 wide x 3 tall)
    box   = one BOX x BOX cell

6 x 4 hour-blocks, each holding 2 x 3 boxes, makes a 12 x 12 field of boxes,
which is 144 = one full day of ten-minute intervals.
